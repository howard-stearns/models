// Provides utilities claim, renewingEdit and release of ownership of a key in and entity, for use among cooperating scripts
// in both repeating and event-driven code. For example,
// * An entity with an entity script may have a Script.update.connect or Script.setInterval function that repeatedly changes
//   properties of the entity. The exported claim function can be used to start the update or interval function in only one
//   of the entity scripts.
// * An interface script used by many people can use the exported claim function to ensure that only one person can operate
//   on an entity at a time (e.g., when multiple people click on the entity).
//
// The goal here is to efficiently avoid duplication of work. It does not absolutely prevent some overlapping edits.
